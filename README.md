# faraną

*A Clojure Wrapper for Apache Felix (OSGi Framework)*

The Faraną project takes its name from Old Norse and Proto-Germanic words with
connotations of movement, travel, and "ways". The initial "f" is a nod to the
Apache Felix project's name, but more so the word was chosen for its sense of
wonder in a larger context: if humanity is ever going to thrive beyond the
bounds of our single planet, we will need to master the art of programming
large, complex systems ... and systems of systems.

So, from the software perspective, this is a "way", a step on our "going"
on the path to the stars.


## Usage

For now, the best way to see how to use faraną is to look at the examples that
have been ported from the
[Apache Felix Tutorial](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/tutorials-examples-and-presentations/apache-felix-osgi-tutorial.html).
So far, these include the following:

* [examples/example1](examples/example1)
* [examples/example2](examples/example2)
